This directory contains all files necessary to build a Windows binary
package that does not require Cygwin, MinGW, OCaml or anything like
that.

DO NOT TRY TO RUN ANY FILES FROM THIS DIRECTORY

If you want to build a Windows binary package, do `make -C
../.. package` (for that, you *do* need Cygwin, MinGW and OCaml)
