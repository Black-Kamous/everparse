This directory contains all files necessary to build a binary
package that does not require Cygwin, MinGW, OCaml or anything like
that.

DO NOT TRY TO RUN ANY FILES FROM THIS DIRECTORY

If you want to build a binary package, do `make -C ../.. package`
. For that, you *do* need OCaml, and for Windows, you also need Cygwin
and MinGW.
